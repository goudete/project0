There is a certain feeling I get when I am in a space that inspires me. Lately these spaces have been coffee shops.
      </p>
      <p>
Coffee shops are mesmerizing because they are a window into the inner workings of a city. You get a taste of what that place has to offer. A coffee shop is like a blank canvas. How the creator chooses to design it is an insight not only into his own creativity but also an insight into the context of where they are.
There are many variables that make a coffee shop great. First of all, the location is crucial. What I have noticed is that regardless of what city you are in, the coolest areas are always filled with cool coffee shops. Hence, if you find the best coffee in a city you will find where the locals hang out.
      </p>
      <p>
Another important variable is the music and design of the place. You want to hang out somewhere that inspires you. A place that by simply sitting there makes you feel good.
And of course, the coffee has to be sublime.
      </p>
      <p>
Clusterfuck coffee is an attempt to help people experience the city they are in through coffee. Coffee is not the end, but the means to experience the city through a local’s perspective.
So I dare you to give it a try, go to one of these coffeeshops, talk to some people you don’t know, ask for recommendations and venture into the unknown. Seek discomfort. It’s worth it.
